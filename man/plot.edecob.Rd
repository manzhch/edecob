\title{Plot Event Data}
\usage{
\method{plot}{edecob}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The output of the \code{edecob} function for one subject. It is an object
of class \code{edecob} containing the data and the event information.}

\item{...}{Other arguments like \code{title}, \code{xlab}, or \code{ylab}.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot2} object that visualizes the data.
}
\description{
Generates a ggplot2 visualizing the data and event if any detected.
}
\details{
The data points are plotted on the x-axis with the study day on the y-axis.
The data from the learning period are gray. The baseline period is outlined
by two vertical blue lines. The smoother is plotted in orange. The confidence
bound  is the blue area. If an event is detected, a red triangle will mark
the detection day.

Since the output is a ggplot, it can be manipulated using the usual functions
from the ggplot2 package like \code{xlim}, \code{ylim}, \code{scale_x_continuous},
and many more.
