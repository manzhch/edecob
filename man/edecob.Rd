\usage{
edecob(
  data,
  study_day,
  subj_id = "subj1",
  bt_tot_rep,
  learn_dur,
  basel_dur,
  event_min_dur = 12 * 7,
  thresh_diff = -0.1,
  smoother = "mov_med",
  width = 12 * 7,
  alpha = 0.05,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A vector containing the data.}

\item{study_day}{A vector containing the study days at which the data points
were collected}

\item{subj_id}{A string containing an identifier for the data.}

\item{bt_tot_rep}{The amount of bootstrap repetitions to be performed.}

\item{learn_dur}{The amount of days where the data is to be ignored.}

\item{basel_dur}{The width of the window in days from which the median is
taken to use as baseline.}

\item{event_min_dur}{The minimal duration the worsening needs to be sustained
to define an event in days.}

\item{thresh_diff}{The percentage difference between the baseline and
threshold. A negative number indicates a threshold below the baseline and
vice versa.}

\item{smoother}{Which smoother is to be used. Currently only \code{mov_med} for
moving median available.}

\item{width}{The width of the window for the moving median in days.}

\item{alpha}{The confidence level for the simultaneous confidence bands.}

\item{plot}{Whether a plot should be generated.}
}
\value{
A list of four values: \describe{ \item{\code{event_detected}}{gives
whether an event was detected}
\item{\code{event_detection_study_day}}{gives the study_day at which the
event was detected} \item{\code{event_duration}}{gives the duration the
event is sustained} \item{\code{event_censored}}{gives whether the detected
event is censored} }
}
\description{
Calculate a smoother of the data and bootstrap it to form simultaneous
confidence bounds. Define an event if the confidence bound is below the
threshold for a predefined amount of time.
}
\details{
Runs the following functions in this order: \enumerate{
\item The smoother depending on choice: \code{\link{mov_med}}
\item \code{\link{smoother_resid}}
\item \code{\link{bt_smoother}}
\item \code{\link{conf_band}}
\item \code{\link{detect_event}}
}
