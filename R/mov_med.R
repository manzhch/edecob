#' Moving Median over a Time Window
#'
#' Calculates the moving median over a time window around a time point for the
#' all time points between the first and last time point provided.
#'
#'   Consider a sample \eqn{X₁,\dots, Xₙ} of size \eqn{n} and the
#'   reordering \eqn{X₍₁₎,\dots, X₍ₙ₎} such
#'   that \eqn{X₍₁₎ \le X₍₂₎ \le \dots \le X₍ₙ₎}, commonly
#'   called the order statistic. Then for \eqn{n} even the median usually
#'   defined as \deqn{median(X₁,\dots, Xₙ) = X₍ₖ₎, where k = n/2.} In the
#'   case where \eqn{n} is odd the median is
#'   defined as \deqn{median(X₁,\dots, Xₙ) = 1/2(X₍ₖ₎ + X₍ₖ₊₁₎), where k = n/2.} Let the
#'   time points at which the measurements \eqn{X₁, \dots, Xₙ} were taken
#'   be \eqn{t₁, \dots, tₙ}.
#'   Let \eqn{T} a fixed positive amount of time. Then
#'   \deqn{S(t) = median({Xⱼ | t - T/2 \le tⱼ \le t + T/2})}
#'   is defined as the moving median at time point \eqn{t} with window size \eqn{T}.
#'
#' For the initial time points where the time difference between the first data
#' point and the time point for which we are calculating the median is less than
#' half the \code{width}, we do not have enough data points to form a window
#' which has the same size to both sides of the time point. In this case fewer
#' data points are used to calculate the median and the time window is not
#' symmetric around the time point for which we are calculating the median.
#'
#' No median is calculated if the time difference between the last data point
#' and the current time point for which we are calculating the median is less
#' than half the \code{width}. We do not calculate the median using a smaller
#' time window so that the values do not change upon receiving new data with
#' time points newer than that of the old data.

#' @inheritParams edecob
#' @param med_win A vector containing two numbers specifying the window over
#'   which the moving median is to be taken. More specifically, when given a
#'   certain time point, the numbers specify the maximum number of time units
#'   difference that a time point can have such that that data point will be
#'   considered for the moving median. Note that the first number must be smaller
#'   than the second number. The numbers may be negative.
#' @param min_pts_in_win The minimal number of measurements required to be in
#'   the time window in order for the median to be calculated.
#'
#' @return A data frame containing the values of the moving median, the study
#'   day to which it corresponds, the time window from which it was calculated,
#'   and the subject id corresponding to the data.
