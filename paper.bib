 abstract = {We propose a sieve bootstrap procedure for time series with a deterministic trend. The sieve for constructing the bootstrap is based on nonparametric trend estimation and autoregressive approximation for some noise process. The bootstrap scheme itself does i.i.d. resampling of estimated innovations from fitted autoregressive models. We show the validity and indicate second-order correctness of such sieve bootstrap approximations for the limiting distribution of nonparametric linear smoothers. The resampling can then be used to construct nonparametric confidence intervals for the underlying trend. In particular, we show asymptotic validity for constructing confidence bands which are simultaneous within a neighborhood of size of the order of the smoothing bandwidth. Our resampling procedure yields satisfactory results in a simulation study for finite sample sizes. We also apply it to the longest series of total ozone measurements from Arosa (Switzerland) and find a significant decreasing trend.},

    abstract = { Observational cohort studies are a powerful tool to assess the long-term outcome in chronic diseases. This study design has been utilized in local and regional outcome studies in multiple sclerosis (MS) and has yielded invaluable epidemiological information. The World Wide Web now provides an excellent opportunity for an international, collaborative cohort study of MS outcomes. A web platform-MSBase-has been designed to collect prospective data on patients with MS. It is purely observational, enabling participating neurologists to contribute data on diagnosis, treatment and progress, to review anonymous aggregate data and to benchmark their patient population against other patient subsets or the entire dataset. MSBase facilitates collaborative research by allowing the online creation of investigator-initiated regional, national and international substudies. The registry aims to answer epidemiological questions that can only be addressed by prospective assessments of large patient cohorts. The registry is funded through the independent MSBase Foundation, and governed by an International Scientific Advisory Board. The MSBase Foundation commenced operations in July 2004 and since then, 22 neurologists from 11 countries have joined MSBase and are contributing 2400 patients to the total data pool. }

    abstract = { Background:Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) can reduce the risk of disability worsening in patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS). High-efficacy DMTs can lead to confirmed or sustained disability improvement (CDI and SDI).Objective and Methods:Post hoc analyses of data from the TRANSFORMS, FREEDOMS, and FREEDOMS II trials and their extensions assessed the effects of fingolimod (0.5–1.25 mg/day) on stabilizing or improving disability over ⩽8 years in participants with RMS. CDI and SDI rates were compared between participants initially randomized to fingolimod, interferon (IFNβ-1a), or placebo.Results:At 8 years’ follow-up in TRANSFORMS, 35.1\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 28.2\%–43.1\%) of assessed participants in the IFNβ-1a–fingolimod switch group and 41.9\% (36.6\%–47.6\%) on continuous fingolimod experienced CDI; disability did not worsen in approximately 70\%. Similar results were seen in the combined FREEDOMS population. Proportionally fewer TRANSFORMS participants achieved SDI in the IFNβ-1a–fingolimod switch group than on continuous fingolimod (5.4\% [3.0\%–9.5\%] vs 14.2\% [10.8\%–18.4\%], p = 0.01).Conclusion:CDI and SDI are outcomes of interest for clinical trials and for long-term follow-up of participants with RMS. Monitoring CDI and SDI in addition to disability worsening may facilitate understanding of the therapeutic benefit of RMS treatments. }

ABSTRACT = {For incurable diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), the prevention of progression and the preservation of quality of life play a crucial role over the entire therapy period. In MS, patients tend to become ill at a younger age and are so variable in terms of their disease course that there is no standard therapy. Therefore, it is necessary to enable a therapy that is as personalized as possible and to respond promptly to any changes, whether with noticeable symptoms or symptomless. Here, measurable parameters of biological processes can be used, which provide good information with regard to prognostic and diagnostic aspects, disease activity and response to therapy, so-called biomarkers Increasing digitalization and the availability of easy-to-use devices and technology also enable healthcare professionals to use a new class of digital biomarkers&mdash;digital health technologies&mdash;to explain, influence and/or predict health-related outcomes. The technology and devices from which these digital biomarkers stem are quite broad, and range from wearables that collect patients&rsquo; activity during digitalized functional tests (e.g., the Multiple Sclerosis Performance Test, dual-tasking performance and speech) to digitalized diagnostic procedures (e.g., optical coherence tomography) and software-supported magnetic resonance imaging evaluation. These technologies offer a timesaving way to collect valuable data on a regular basis over a long period of time, not only once or twice a year during patients&rsquo; routine visit at the clinic. Therefore, they lead to real-life data acquisition, closer patient monitoring and thus a patient dataset useful for precision medicine. Despite the great benefit of such increasing digitalization, for now, the path to implementing digital biomarkers is widely unknown or inconsistent. Challenges around validation, infrastructure, evidence generation, consistent data collection and analysis still persist. In this narrative review, we explore existing and future opportunities to capture clinical digital biomarkers in the care of people with MS, which may lead to a digital twin of the patient. To do this, we searched published papers for existing opportunities to capture clinical digital biomarkers for different functional systems in the context of MS, and also gathered perspectives on digital biomarkers under development or already existing as a research approach.},

    abstract = "{Current Parkinson disease (PD) measures are subjective, rater-dependent, and assessed in clinic. Smartphones can measure PD features, yet no smartphone-derived rating score exists to assess motor symptom severity in real-world settings.To develop an objective measure of PD severity and test construct validity by evaluating the ability of the measure to capture intraday symptom fluctuations, correlate with current standard PD outcome measures, and respond to dopaminergic therapy.This observational study assessed individuals with PD who remotely completed 5 tasks (voice, finger tapping, gait, balance, and reaction time) on the smartphone application. We used a novel machine-learning–based approach to generate a mobile Parkinson disease score (mPDS) that objectively weighs features derived from each smartphone activity (eg, stride length from the gait activity) and is scaled from 0 to 100 (where higher scores indicate greater severity). Individuals with and without PD additionally completed standard in-person assessments of PD with smartphone assessments during a period of 6 months.Ability of the mPDS to detect intraday symptom fluctuations, the correlation between the mPDS and standard measures, and the ability of the mPDS to respond to dopaminergic medication.The mPDS was derived from 6148 smartphone activity assessments from 129 individuals (mean [SD] age, 58.7 [8.6] years; 56 [43.4\\%] women). Gait features contributed most to the total mPDS (33.4\\%). In addition, 23 individuals with PD (mean [SD] age, 64.6 [11.5] years; 11 [48\\%] women) and 17 without PD (mean [SD] age 54.2 [16.5] years; 12 [71\\%] women) completed in-clinic assessments. The mPDS detected symptom fluctuations with a mean (SD) intraday change of 13.9 (10.3) points on a scale of 0 to 100. The measure correlated well with the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson Disease’s Rating Scale total (r = 0.81; P \\&lt; .001) and part III only (r = 0.88; P \\&lt; .001), the Timed Up and Go assessment (r = 0.72; P = .002), and the Hoehn and Yahr stage (r = 0.91; P \\&lt; .001). The mPDS improved by a mean (SD) of 16.3 (5.6) points in response to dopaminergic therapy.Using a novel machine-learning approach, we created and demonstrated construct validity of an objective PD severity score derived from smartphone assessments. This score complements standard PD measures by providing frequent, objective, real-world assessments that could enhance clinical care and evaluation of novel therapeutics.}",
